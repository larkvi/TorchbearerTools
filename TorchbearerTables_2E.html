    'Blustery Winds.<br/><br/>These strong, cold winds can chill to the bone and turn simple tasks into seemingly monumental challenges. However, it&#8217;s excellent sailing weather. In blustery winds:<ul><li>Lighting a fire (including torches and lanterns) without shelter from the wind requires a test, even if you have a tinderbox.</li><li>All social tests suffer a -1s penalty.</li><li>Sailor tests are granted +1D.</li><li>Toll in blustery winds: +1</li></ul>',
    'Clear and Cool<br/><br/>On days when the sun is shining, the winds are quiet, and the wildflowers and fruit orchards are blossoming it is a joy to be on the open road. In clear and cool weather:<ul><li>Travelers are granted +1D to recover from angry or afraid.</li><li>Scavenger tests to forage are granted +1D.</li><li>Toll in clear and cool weather: -1</li></ul>',
    'Cold Snap<br/><br/>',
    'Crisp and Cold<br/><br/>Fall and winter weather isn&#8217;t all dreariness. Some days dawn clear and bitingly cold, granting the land a raw-boned beauty under icy blue skies. In crisp and cold weather:<ul><li>Travelers are +1D to recover from angry or exhausted.</li><li>Hunter tests to catch game are granted +1D.</li><li>Toll in crisp and cold weather: +0</li></ul>',
    'Extreme Cold<br/><br/>Some winter days are so cold that your bones ache and your lungs burn with each breath. Any exposed flesh that hasn&#8217;t been smeared with animal grease is at risk of frostbite. In extreme cold:<ul><li>Any tests that involve fine motor control suffer a +1 Ob or -1s penalty as appropriate.</li><li>The injured condition (frostbite) is an appropriate consequence for any failed test.</li><li>Characters who become wet and cannot immediately get to shelter and warmth must make an Ob 4 Health test. Suggested condition: sick from hypothermia.</li><li>Death is an appropriate consequence for any failed test involving someone who is injured or sick.</li><li>Toll in extreme cold: +1</li></ul>',
    'Fog<br/><br/>At times, dense, soupy fogs settle on the land, drastically limiting visibility and muting sounds. Traveling in unfamiliar lands is treacherous under such conditions. In fog:<ul><li>Travelers suffer a +1 Ob penalty to Pathfinder tests and actions that depend upon seeing great distances, like perceiving ambushers sneaking toward them.</li><li>When adventurers fail tests, the game master may choose to make them lost or separated in addition to the twist or condition imposed.</li><li>All are granted +1D to actions that involve sneaking or stealth.</li><li>Toll in fog: +0</li>',
    'Frost<br/><br/>In fall and winter, clear nights offer their own special danger: blankets of hoarfrost and rime. Beautiful to be sure, but potentially deadly if care is not taken to prevent one&#8217;s clothes and gear from taking the wet. In frost:<ul><li>All Sailor tests suffer a +1 Ob penalty as boats, ships and their rigging become unwieldy from the weight of ice.</li><li>Adventurers sleeping in the open must make an Ob 2 Health test when leaving camp. Suggested condition: exhausted or injured from frostbite. Suggested twist: clothing becomes wet.</li><li>Toll in frost: +0</li>',
    'Gale<br/><br/>At times, blustery winds turn into violent blows that can bring down branches from trees, pluck people from the sides of mountains and break masts laden with too much sail. In a gale:<ul><li>It is impossible to light a fire without shelter.</li><li>Spoken communication is extremely difficult.</li><li>Any outdoor skill or ability test suffers a +1 Ob penalty, particularly Sailor and Dungeoneer tests.</li><li>Adventurers who spend significant time in a gale must make an Ob 3 Health test. Suggested condition: exhausted or injured.</li><li>Exhausted and injured are appropriate conditions for failed tests.</li><li>Toll in a gale: +2</li>',
    'Heatwave<br/><br/>Occasionally, spring will bring warm weather early and suddenly. While the warmer temperatures are often welcome, the rain and rapidly melting snow and ice can lead to floods and other extremely dangerous conditions. Avalanches become likely in mountainous areas, and settlements and fords can be washed out by swollen rivers. In a heatwave:<ul><li>Tests involving fording rivers or streams during spring suffer a +1 Ob penalty.</li><li>Tests involving heavy exertion or running suffer a +1 Ob penalty.</li><li>Toll in a heatwave: +1</li></ul>',
    'Ice Storm<br/><br/>The freezing rains of ice storms can be a deceptive killer. The glaze of ice that covers everything is eerily beautiful, but it hides many dangers. Being caught at sea in an ice storm is especially perilous. In an ice storm:<ul><li>Outdoor skill or ability tests suffer a +1 Ob penalty, including Pathfinder, Sailor or even Fighter.</li><li>It is extremely difficult to spend any length of time outdoors without getting soaked to the skin. Adventurers that become wet in this way must make an Ob 3 Health test. Suggested condition: sick from hypothermia.</li><li>Toll in an ice storm: +2</li></ul>',
    'Rain<br/><br/>Cold, heavy rains can last for days, leaving everyone miserable and soaked to the skin. In rain:<ul><li>Outdoor skill or ability tests suffer a +1 Ob penalty, particularly Pathfinder and Scout tests. Cartography tests are impossible without shelter of some sort.</li><li>At their discretion, the game master may call for adventurers working or fighting outdoors to make an Ob 2 Health test (be sure to add +1D if wearing a cloak, though). Suggested condition: exhausted. The Breath of the Burning Lord invocation can negate the need to make this test.</li><li>Toll in rain: +1</li></ul>',
    'Snow<br/><br/>Heavy, wet snow is common in from mid-fall to early spring. In snow:<ul><li>Outdoor skill or ability tests suffer a +1 Ob penalty, including Pathfinder, Sailor or even Fighter.</li><li>Using Scout to track is granted +1D.</li><li>Exhausted and injured are appropriate conditions for failed tests.</li><li>Toll in snow: +2</li>',
    'Storm<br/><br/>Late in spring, the land is sometimes rocked by violent storms, which include thunder, lightning and hail. In addition to the risk of flash flooding, the winds and lightning make activity outdoors hazardous. In late summer, the lightning brings the risk of wildfires. In storms:<ul><li>Outdoor skill or ability tests suffer a +1 Ob penalty, including Pathfinder, Sailor or even Fighter.</li><li>Exhausted and injured are appropriate conditions for failed tests.</li><li>Toll in a storm: +2</li>',
    'Thundersnow<br/><br/>Thundersnow is an unusual and dangerous type of storm that combines blizzard conditions with heavy winds, lightning and hail or graupel. In thundersnow:<ul><li>All skill or ability tests suffer a +1 Ob penalty. Cartography tests are impossible without shelter of some sort.</li><li>All travel requires a Pathfinder test, even with a map. Maps act as gear, but consulting the map requires shelter of some sort.</li><li>Death is on the line. Dead is the suggested condition for anyone who is injured or sick, no matter the test.</li><li>All travelers suffer a +1 Ob penalty to recovery tests in the next camp or town phase.</li><li>The game master should make twists catastrophic.</li><li>Once the weather passes, all who traveled in it must make an Ob 4 Health test. Suggested condition: injured or sick.</li><li>Toll in thundersnow: +3</li></ul>',
    'Unseasonably Warm<br/><br/>The Burning Lord sometimes blesses the land with warmth. This sunshine is joyous to those who have been sequestered in their steadings over the long, cold winter months, but such weather is not without its dangers. Rapidly melting snow and ice can create deep mud, swollen rivers and lead to flash floods, mudslides or avalanches. In unseasonably warm weather:<ul><li>All tests involving fording rivers or streams suffer a +1 Ob penalty.</li><li>Twists might include: mud, flash floods, washed out bridges, washed out fords, mudslides, avalanche.</li><li>All are granted +1D to recover from exhausted and afraid.</li><li>Toll in unseasonably warm weather: +1</li></ul>',
    'Warm and Bright<br/><br/>The bright days of summer are a reminder to all that it is a joy to live in the Sunlit Realms&mdash;the days are long, the sun is warm upon the skin and the crops reach toward the sky. In warm and bright weather:<ul><li>Adventurers are granted +2D to recover from angry, afraid or exhausted and +1D to recover from sick and injured.</li><li>Scavenger tests for forage are granted +1D.</li><li>Survivalist tests are granted +1D.</li><li>Toll in warm and bright weather: -1</li></ul>'

          <blockquote>
            Town Events Roll Bonuses
            Town events rolls are difficult to modify in one&#8217;s favor. There are only a handful
            of possible bonuses:
            <ul>
              <li>The Hearthmistress&#8217;s Favor, gained by praying at a shrine, grants +1 to
                the next town events roll.
              </li>
              <li>A Steward skill test to maintain the works and projects of a settlement grants
                +1 to the next town events roll for that particular settlement.
              </li>
              <li>A skald who establishes a court of the wise in a settlement grants it +1 to town
                events rolls so long as the court remains.
              </li>
              <li>Increate theurges add +1 to town events rolls for settlements allied with
                them.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Town Events Roll Penalties
            <ul>
              <li>Each disaster event rolled causes an ongoing -1 penalty to town events rolls for
                this settlement. Each additional disaster imposes a cumulative penalty.
                Adventures may endeavor to ameliorate disasters or certain town events may
                mitigate their effects and remove the penalty. A disaster is any event that
                forces an early end to a town phase or destroys a facility, location or amenity.
              </li>
              <li>Increate theurges suffer -1 to town events rolls in settlements opposed to
                them.

        <p><i>Editor&#8217;s note</i>: The amount of loot generated by the tables in the books seems to be much lower
          than the amount of loot that Thor and Luke actually include in their adventures, based upon published
          adventures and play reports. Using these numbers without additional placed valuables will result in much
          poorer characters who will have a much more difficult time in town.</p>
